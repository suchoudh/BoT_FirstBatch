# BoT_FirstBatch
This is the repo containing notes for the first batch on Cloud Computing. Will try to finish this in 20 hours of overall runtime. 

An unorganized repo containing a lot of good stuff is kept here [https://github.com/suchoudh/awsbit] Feel free to go through it and hopefully i will make it organized as time progresses.  ~  Sunil@Feb4 2023
